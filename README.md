Change OC Project and set in TILLER_NAMESPACE env variable

If you are using OpenShift and moving through projects / namespaces constantly via `oc project <ns>` then you have a hard tilel to use `Helm`.

Atleast for me I felt that as a hard task. So I wrote a small `bash function` and `source`ed it into my profile.
